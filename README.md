# React-Clicky-Game

(Note: Ignore the typo in the screenshot. I originally had 9 photos, then added in a 10th one).

<br>For some reason, deploying it to github.io renders the readme instead of the app... so I shared it on Heroku instead.

<h2>Overview:</h2>
The goal of this game is to successfully click on all 10 images only ONCE. If you do, you win! The images are randomized after every click, which makes this game a little more challenging.

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
React.js | HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript

<h2>Learning Points:</h2>
React was a little hard to navigate, but I understand how powerful and innovative this new technology is. It initally felt a little tedious having to create and style all separate components, just to combine them all into one single file. However, the ability to fresh a specific part of the page (as opposed to the entire page), is AWESOME!
